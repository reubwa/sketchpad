# sketchpad

A basic drawing program I wrote in pure HTML5, JS and CSS in order to practice using them. I used [this article](https://www.programonaut.com/how-to-draw-on-an-html-canvas-with-a-mouse/) to get started, I then used W3Schools, Stack Overflow and my own knowledge in order to add additional features.

Unfortunately, at present there is no option on the page to save your canvas. You have to right click on the canvas itself and select 'Save As'.

Try this in your browser [here](https://reubwa.github.io/sketchpad/) (WARNING! It is very rudimentary)
